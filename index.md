<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the Rapid-Rich Object Search Lab (<a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/rose">ROSE</a>) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), supervised by <a href="https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/exdjiang">Prof. Jiang Xudong</a> and <a href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/zq">Dr. Qian Zheng</a>. I received the Master degree at the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, NTU, majoring in computer control and automation, and the Bachelor degree at the School of Traffic and Transportation, Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU), majoring in Intelligent Transportation Engineering.

My research interests are broad due to my interdisciplinary background. Previously, I was mainly working on reinforcement learning and multi-agent systems. Now, I focus more on computer vision and computer graphics, working on projects involving PBR, photometric stereo, NeRF, and generative model (especially for 3D generation).

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision**: Photometric stereo, representation learning, 3D perception
- **Computer Graphics**: PBR, inverse rendering, NeRF
- **Generative Models**: 3D generation, diffusion, consistency distillation
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Multi-agent systems (previous work)
